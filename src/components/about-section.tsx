            I‚Äôm Dawit Bonga ‚Äî a Computer Science student at Yale University and an aspiring
            software engineer who loves building tools that solve real problems. 
            From systems programming to machine learning and web apps, I enjoy 
            understanding how things work under the hood and turning that knowledge 
            into projects that feel intuitive and impactful.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I‚Äôve interned at Amazon Web Services on the Bedrock fine-tuning team, 
            where I worked on integration testing for model pipelines and learned
            how large-scale systems come together. Outside of class, I build 
            side projects ‚Äî from an NBA prop bet predictor to a college roadmap 
            generator ‚Äî that combine backend logic with clean, responsive interfaces.
            My goal is to keep creating software that‚Äôs both technically sound 
            and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me mentoring students 
            through Code Haven, helping first-generation students navigate college
            through my TikTok projects, or watching a Warriors game(I love Basketball). I'm always down to learn more so I watch/read a lot about other cultures and people.
